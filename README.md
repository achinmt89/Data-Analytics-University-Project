# Task
You are an analyst at a data analytics consulting firm. Your manager has currently tasked you in providing a report to an American client. The client is a major U.S. wireless telecommunications company which provides cellular telephone service.
The client has asked your consulting firm for assistance in developing a predictive model that helps them predict customer churn and helps establish a target customer profile for implementing a proactive churn management program.
Nowadays, telecom industry faces fierce competition in satisfying its customers. Churn is a marketing-related term that characterizes whether a current customer decides to take their business elsewhere (in the current context, to switch from one mobile service provider to another). As with many other sectors, churn is an important issue for the wireless telecommunications industry. The role of a churn prediction system is not only restricted to accurately predicting churn, but also to interpreting customer churn behavior.
Your main tasks will involve data manipulation, cleaning, modelling, and writing a report, including recom- mendations. In particular, out of 10,000 customers in the eval_data.csv evaluation dataset you must identify 3000 customers which you believe are most likely to churn. Your client also wants a non-technical description of the characteristics of customer churn that could assist in the development of a risk management strategy, i.e. a proactive churn management program.

# Data
1. Training data that is used to test the performance of the models.
2. Evaluation data for which the selected model will predict whether the customer will churn or not.
